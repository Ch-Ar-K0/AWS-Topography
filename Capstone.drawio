AWS Capstone Synoposis

 I chose my diagram as the way I think of the cloud schematic: 

 1. End user starts search
 2. Internet search to Internet Gateway
 3. Load Balancer determines round robin where to send traffic
 4. Nat Gateway pushes it ec2 instance where it can bring up the request via the S3 bucket contents
 5. Ec2 can then query the RDS depending on what is being requested by the query and user
